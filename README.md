Andrew J Bagwell Liri-Bot app

What the project does?:
LIRI is a Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI will be a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data.

Here's how the app works?:
When navigated to the folder "Liri-Bot" in your terminal, you can type the commands listed below to run 4 different functions that retrieve data, and give it back to you in the console.

1) node liri.js concert-this "insert band name". In my example video, I typed band "Imagine Dragons"
2) node liri.js spotify-this-song "insert song name". In my example video, I typed song name "Yesterday" by the Beatles.
   -If you enter only "node liri.js spotify-this-song" with no song name, it will default search The Sign", by Ace of Base.
3) node liri.,js movie-this "insert movie name". In my example video, I typed name "The Fall". This is a great movie by Director: Tarsem Singh. 
   -If you enter only "node liri.js movie-this" with no movie name, it will default search Mr. Nobody", and display info.
4) node liri.js do-what-it-says. In my video example, this searched song "I Want it That Way" through Spotify API. 
This command will search my "random.txt" folder and read and search what ever text is in the folder.

Why the project is useful?:

Teaches me javascript, ajax calls, retrieving info from APIs, node, axios, Moment and DotEnv.

Who maintains and contributes to the project?:

Andrew J Bagwell.
